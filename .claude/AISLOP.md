# aislop — agent instructions

[aislop](https://github.com/scanaislop/aislop) is your guardrail for shipping clean, maintainable, production-grade code. It catches the patterns AI coding tools leave behind: dead imports, redundant code, duplicate logic, unsafe any-typed casts, narrative comments, swallowed errors, hidden fallbacks, oversized functions, risky security constructs — and grades the project out of 100 so regressions are visible. Treat its findings as blocking, not advisory: the goal is code a human maintainer would happily inherit.

## On every edit

A PostToolUse hook runs `aislop hook claude` after every Edit, Write, or MultiEdit. It scans the touched files and returns findings as JSON `additionalContext` shaped like `AislopFeedback` (schema `aislop.hook.v2` — score, baseline, delta, regressed, counts, findings, newSinceBaseline, suggestedActions). Act on them the same turn; the `suggestedActions` field tells you exactly what to run next.

## Severity ladder

- `error` — MUST fix this turn.
- `warning` + `fixable: true` — MUST fix this turn.
- `warning` + `fixable: false` — fix if trivially mechanical, otherwise surface in your reply.

## Rules

- `.aislop/config.yaml` — thresholds and engine toggles. Treat as authoritative; don't edit without user consent.
- `.aislop/rules.yaml` — project-specific architecture rules (may be absent). When a finding cites `architecture/*`, open this file and follow it.
- Custom rules can change between sessions. Trust what the scan returns, not a cached understanding of what the rules are.

## Principles

- Do not disable rules to pass the scan. Fix the underlying issue.
- If a finding is a false positive, leave it and explain in your reply — do not delete the rule config.
- The findings payload includes `nextSteps[]` — treat those as your plan for the turn.
